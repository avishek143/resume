      <h2 class="pb-2 text-center">A Brief History of My Time</h2>
      <div class="px-lg-5 lead fw-normal">
        <p>
          For 15 years from September 2004, I was the quintessential Software
          Guy. I started off at
          <a href="https://www.wipro.com/" target="_blank">Wipro Technologies</a
          >, Hyderabad, India, as a J2EE Web Developer, building classical B2B
          websites using the Struts Framework. In July 2009, I joined
          <a href="https://www.pega.com/" target="_blank">Pegasystems</a> as
          part of their fledgling R&D unit in India. Over the next 10 years I
          worked up various roles at Pega from being a Front End Engineer in
          their first UI Team to architecting their Mobile web solutions as
          Technical Lead to building the Scrum teams for their first Full Stack
          Cloud Native MERN solutions as Engineering Manager and finally running
          Pega's Omni Channel Customer Service Communication Platform as the
          Senior Product Manager. My later years at Pega were especially
          thrilling as I got to work on the integration of the various startups
          Pega acquired and thoroughly enjoyed the exposure to the fast paced
          and adaptive culture of these gems and their founding teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my 15<sup>th</sup>
          work-versary in September 2019 I decided it was time to take that
          longish break from work to spend time and travel with the loves of my
          life - my 3 dogs. The next one year was a bitter sweet rollercoaster
          of road trips, COVID-19, lockdowns, unlocks and the second wave!
          Amongst all this, as I thought through the next chapter of my life, I
          decided it must be something to do with dogs and startups. Thus, in
          January 2021,
          <a href="https://www.tailtrails.in/" target="_blank">TailTrails</a>
          started taking shape with the objective of offering products and
          services that address the fundamentals of care giving for pets and
          doesn't bother about floroscent green dog beds. As I work my ay the
          solid foundations of my company, I also intend to freelance for other
          startups and offer the value of my past in their present and fuel the
          success of their future.

              In all my Software Engineering roles I have always been thrilled
              to walk up to the white board, flesh out a piece of architecture
              and then code it down. Hence most of my memorable Engineering
              moments have architecture and code at their center. Here go a few:
            </p>
            <ul class="d-grid gap-2">
              <li>
                At Wipro I designed and implemeted the Struts front end UI
                project for the dealer dashboard they were building for Cisco by
                integrating a myriad of backend ETL systems
              </li>
              <li>
                In my first project at Pega I revamped their UI Event Handling
                model to reduce the n event handlers for their repeating element
                to just the 1 attached to the body and eliminated memory
                blowouts
              </li>
              <li>
                Before websockets were a thing, long polling was the goto
                solution for server push. I designed Pega's Bayeux Protocol
                based long polling solution to update the front-end with the
                server state.
              </li>
              <li>
                My most cherished work at Pega was the integration and
                development of the Co-browse product Pega acquired from a
                fabulous startup, Firefly. The folks at Firefly had done a
                wonderful job with their product. But as it happens with all
                acquitions, processes and practices need to be brought in line.
                I was Engineering Manager for this integration. We introduced
                Devops to the project, added License and Security Scans as part
                of release readiness checks and upgraded the entire stack of
                Node.js, Mongo, Redis, Socket.io and a few other things. But the
                work that excited me the most was utilizing the Co-browse
                technology to create a video-less screen recorder and player.
                Think of a HD Quality 5 minutes video that's powered by just a
                500kB JSON file!
              </li>
              <li>
                And now I am onto the most ambitious project of my life -
                Building the most amazing Doggie website ever - TailTrails!

          I have always enjoyed knowing the people I have worked with. About
          their lives, their likes, their families, about what keeps them
          ticking and what got them here (in life i.e.). I hope you do the same.
          So, here's a bit about me, personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and brought up in the small beautiful hilly town named
          Ranchi that's the capital of the state of Jharkhand in India. After
          finishing school, I did my Bachelor of Science in Computer
          Applications from
          <a href="https://www.sxcran.org/" target="_blank">
            St. Xavier's College, Ranchi </a
          >, the alma mater for my whole family. And then began the most
          enthralling chapter of my life as part of the
          <a href="https://careers.wipro.com/wilp" target="_blank"
            >WASE Program</a
          >
          (now WILP) at Wipro, where I completed my M.S. in Software Engineering
          from
          <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank"
            >BITS, Pilani</a
          >. The rest, as I say, is History!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I live in the (very disputed) Biryani Capital of India - Hyderabad
          - with my wife and our 3 dogs - Auro, Abbie and Genie. When not
          perched on my work chair, I am positioned in our kitchen. I'm the
          undisputed Chef De Cuisine of the house! At other times I can be found
          either behind a book or behind my car's steering wheel. We are a very
          road-faring family always on the lookout for dog friendly experiences.
          Our hope is to find more of them in India and TailTrails is our
          endeavor to make it happen.
