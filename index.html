      <h2 class="pb-2 text-center">A Brief History of My Time</h2>
      <div class="px-lg-5 lead fw-normal">
        <p>
          For 15 years from September 2004, I was the quintessential Software
          Guy. I started of at
          <a href="https://www.wipro.com/" target="_blank">Wipro Technologies</a
          >, Hyderabad, India, as a J2EE Web Developer, building classical B2B
          websites using the Struts Framework. In July 2009, I joined
          <a href="https://www.pega.com/" target="_blank">Pegasystems</a> as
          part of their fledgling R&D unit in India. Over the next 10 years I
          worked up various roles at Pega from being a Front End Engineer in
          their first UI Team to architecting their Mobile web solutions as
          Technical Lead to building the Scrum teams for their first Full Stack
          Cloud Native MERN solutions as Engineering Manager and finally running
          Pega's Omni Channel Customer Service Communication Platform as the
          Senior Product Manager. My later years at Pega were especially
          thrilling as I got to work on the integration of the various startups
          Pega acquired and thoroughly enjoyed the exposure to the fast paced
          and adaptive culture of these gems.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my 15<sup>th</sup>
          work-versary in September 2019 I decided it was time to take that
          longish break from work to spend time and travel with the loves of my
          life - my 3 dogs - Auro, Abbie and Genie. The next one year was a
          bitter sweet rollercoaster of road trips, COVID-19 and lockdowns.
          Amongst all this, as I thought through the next chapter of my life, I
          decided it must be something to do with dogs and startups. Thus, in
          January 2021,
          <a href="https://www.tailtrails.in/" target="_blank">TailTrails</a>
          started taking shape with the objective of offering products and
          services that address the fundamentals of care giving for pets and
          doesn't bother about floroscent green dog beds. As I work through my
          own startup, I also intend to freelance for other startups and offer
          the value of my value of my past while sharing in the success of their
          present.

              A constant I maintained in all my Software Engineering roles has
              been the ability to come up with an architecture on a white board
              and then code it down without having to roll up the sleeves. Hence
              most of my memorable Engineering moments have architecture and
              code at their center. Here go a few:
            </p>
            <ul class="d-grid gap-2">
              <li>
                At Wipro I designed and implemeted the Struts front end UI
                project for the Dealer dashboard they were building for Cisco
              </li>
              <li>
                In my first project at Pega I revamped their UI Event Handling
                model to reduce the n event handlers they were attaching for
                their repeating element to just the 1 attached to the body and
                eliminated memory blowouts
              </li>
              <li>
                Before websockets were a thing, long polling was the goto
                solution for server push. I designed Pega's Bayeux Protocol
                based long polling solution to update the front-end with the
                server state.
              </li>
              <li>
                My most cherished work at Pega was the integration and development of the
                Co-browse product Pega acquired from a fabulous startup,
                Firefly. The folks at Firefly had done a fabulous job with their
                product. But as it happens with all acquitions, processes and
                practices need to be brought in line. I was Engineering Manager
                for this integration. We introduced Devops to the project, added
                License and Security Scan as part of release readiness checks
                and upgraded the entire Node Modules stack. But the work that
                excited me the most was utilizing the Co-browse technology to
                create a video-less screen recorder and player. Think of a HD
                Quality 5 min video that's powered by a 500kB JSON file!
              </li>
              <li>
                And now I am onto the most ambitious project of my life -
                Building the most amazing Doggie website ever - TailTrails!

              How often do our designations actually reflect our roles? And how
              often do our roles restrict the responsibilities we fulfill in our

      <div class="px-lg-5 lead fw-normal">
        <p>
          I have always enjoyed knowing the people I have worked with. About
          their lives, their likes, their families, about what keeps them
          ticking and what got them here (in life). I hope you do the same. So,
          here's a bit about me, personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and brought up in the small beautiful hilly town named
          Ranchi in the state of Jharkhand in India. After finishing school, I
          did my Bachelor of Science in Computer Applications from St. Xavier's
          College, Ranchi. And then began the most enthralling journey of all
          times as part of the WASE Program at Wipro where I completed my M.S.
          in Software Engineering from BITS, Pilani. The rest as I say is my
          History!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I live in the (very disputed) Biryani Capital of India - Hyderabad
          - with my wife and our 3 dogs. When not perched on my work chair, I am
          located in our kitchen. I'm the self declared Chef De Cuisine. At
          other times I can found either behind a book or behind my car's
          steering wheel. We are a very road-faring family always on the lookout
          for dog friendly experiences. Our hope is to find more of them in
          India and TailTrails is our endeavor to make it happen.
